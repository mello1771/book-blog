                    <p>When I got these books from the library, I didn't even really know what it was about. All I knew was that I heard about it
                        somewhere online and that it was a Chinese fantasy novel. Little did I know was that I was about to read the first five books
                        in a couple of weeks. I wasn't completely sure of it at first because the first novel was a bit slow, but then it picked up
                        right away. The plot was so complex and it dove into the characters' backgrounds and emotions so well. This is a fantasy romance
                        book, so the romance was one of the biggest parts that made me love this series so much. The relationship was somewhat slowburn 
                        and it was just so fun to read. There were so many parts that made me laugh or cry, and I really just loved reading this series.

                    <p>Out of the danmeis in this list, I read this series most recently. And I finished it in a little more than a week. I really
                        just couldn't put it down. This series is seriously one of the most underrated danmei series- I feel like there is so little
                        fandom activity online, especially compared to the other more popular series like Mo Xiang Tong Xiu's works. The plot was so 
                        interesting, with the smaller mysteries and the overarching mystery. I also loved the main couple's relationship- it was definitely
                        more slowburn and the only thing I have to complain about it is that I wish that there was more content of them together after
                        they pretty much established their relationship. But I loved that they were able to show how much they cared for each other
                        through the smallest things. This series really surprised me, and I'm glad I gave it a try.
