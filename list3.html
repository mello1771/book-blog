                    <p>When I got these books from the library, I didn't even really know what it was about. All I knew was that I heard about it
                        somewhere online and that it was a Chinese fantasy novel. Little did I know was that I was about to read the first five books
                        in a couple of weeks. I wasn't completely sure of it at first because the first novel was a bit slow, but then it picked up
                        right away. The plot was so complex and it dove into the characters' backgrounds and emotions so well. This is a fantasy romance
                        book, so the romance was one of the biggest parts that made me love this series so much. The relationship was somewhat slowburn 
                        and it was just so fun to read. There were so many parts that made me laugh or cry, and I really just loved reading this series.

                    <p>Out of the danmeis in this list, I read this series most recently. And I finished it in a little more than a week. I really
                        just couldn't put it down. This series is seriously one of the most underrated danmei series- I feel like there is so little
                        fandom activity online, especially compared to the other more popular series like Mo Xiang Tong Xiu's works. The plot was so 
                        interesting, with the smaller mysteries and the overarching mystery. I also loved the main couple's relationship- it was definitely
                        more slowburn and the only thing I have to complain about it is that I wish that there was more content of them together after
                        they pretty much established their relationship. But I loved that they were able to show how much they cared for each other
                        through the smallest things. This series really surprised me, and I'm glad I gave it a try.

                    <p>This was the third danmei series that I had read and it was off the recommendation of my friend. I had been wanting to read
                        more danmeis, so I decided to read the only series from Mo Xiang Tong Xiu that I hadn't read yet. This is her most popular 
                        work and it definitely didn't disappoint. My favorite parts of these books were the flashback scenes to when the two main 
                        characters were younger and in the academy together. I really liked the dynamic between the two characters, but the only things
                        that I didn't like as much were the ending and extras. I felt like the ending just went in a direction that I didn't like as much 
                        as the rest of the story, and there was just a little too much smut at the end and in the extras for me. But I still enjoyed reading
                        this danmei and I definitely do recommend it.

                    <p>I have mixed feeligns about this danmei. This was the second danmei I read and I had read it after reading Heaven Official's Blessing,
                        which definitely set the bar high. I liked the first two books the best because the story was just starting and it I thought it was
                        pretty entertaining. But I didn't love the two characters' dynamic as the story progressed. I still liked reading the romance, but I 
                        felt, espcially towards the end, that it was pretty toxic. Overall, I did like the plot, but it was definitely not my favorite danmei.
