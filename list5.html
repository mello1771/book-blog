                    <p> The Six of Crows duology, containing Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom, is one of my absolute favorite series. 
                        The world is clearly so well thought out because of the complexity of the different nations, magic, and customs
                        in the Grishaverse. What I appreciated the most about these books were the characters and how they interacted
                        with each other. They each had a unique personality and story, and as the reader, I was able to truly understand
                        their motivations because of the different perspectives of each of the chapters. Even the characters who didn't 
                        have their own chapters were still complex and well-written. Overall, I really enjoyed reading these two books.

                    <p> This series has three books:
                        Caraval, Legendary, and Finale. This series made me realize how much I love books that just feel magical.
                        Throughout these three books, particularly Caraval, I could just feel the magic in this world. I loved going
                        through the book and figuring out the mysteries when the main character did. Because of the magical elements,
                        it was difficult to predict what would happen next. I also thouroughly enjoyed the romance aspect of the series.
                        The relationships of the two couples were throughout all three of the books and I appreciated how they
                        impacted the plot. I also loved how the author created another book series in the same world with some of the 
                        same characters because I got to see what happened to them after the trilogy ended. This series will always
                        be one of my favorites and so I highly recommend it.

                    <p>I read this book most recently out of my favorites, and I was somewhat surprised to like it so much. My friend and 
                        I picked out two books to read together, and I actually thought that I would like the other one better. However,
                        I was proven wrong. This book began with action, and that stayed throughout the entire book. Even though it was
                        only 321 pages, the author managed to create a complex plot that had a lot of action and different elements to it,
                        but made sense and didn't feel rushed. I didn't think that this book had a lot of romance in it, but I was pleasantly
                        surprised. The relationship between the two characters was sweet and felt natural. I'm glad that I gave this book a chance
                        because it is now one of my favorites!

                    <p>The majority of books I read are fantasy, but this 
                        book really stood out to me, even though it's realistic or literary fiction- which I often dislike. I read this book 
                        for school, and it was my favorite book that we read that year. The plot was very unique and even though the concept
                        was a bit far-fetched, the writing made it feel very realistic. I enjoyed both parts of the story- even though the beginning
                        seemed to be a bit slow, I appreciated every part of it. The book just seemed beautiful to me and so it became one 
                        of my favorites. I will always think of this book fondly.

                    <p>When I got these books from the library, I didn't even really know what it was about. All I knew was that I heard about it
                        somewhere online and that it was a Chinese fantasy novel. Little did I know was that I was about to read the first five books
                        in a couple of weeks. I wasn't completely sure of it at first because the first novel was a bit slow, but then it picked up
                        right away. The plot was so complex and it dove into the characters' backgrounds and emotions so well. This is a fantasy romance
                        book, so the romance was one of the biggest parts that made me love this series so much. The relationship was somewhat slowburn 
                        and it was just so fun to read. There were so many parts that made me laugh or cry, and I really just loved reading this series.

                    <p>This series is seriously one of my favorite series. For some reason, although it's fairly popular, it seems a little 
                        bit underrated to me. I've read the first two books, and the third one just came out, so I'm very excited to read it.
                        I read these books as a little treat every night before I go to bed, because they're just so cozy and comforting for me.
                        There are several issues and problems that Emily has to face, but the books just have an overall very warm and lighthearted
                        feeling to them. I love Emily and the love interest's romance together, it's just so cozy. These books will always be
                        a safe place for me.

                        seeing the main characters' journey through game development and how other people affected their games so much. However, I 
                        honestly didn't like the second half of the book as much. I was really surprised at the main characters' falling out and also
                        the death of Marx. I didn't like the direction the book had gone in, but I still liked it enough to give it four stars.

                        I definitely recommend Graceling and I don't think its necessary to read the other books in the series!
