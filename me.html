        <h1>About Chloe</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Hi everyone! As you can tell, my name is Chloe and I really like to read! I made this small book blog just
            so I can track my thoughts on the books that I read! I also wanted to share some recommendations through
            book lists!
            My all-time favorite genre is fantasy, but I also enjoy reading romance, mystery, and thriller books!
            I hope you enjoy reading my reviews!
        </p>
