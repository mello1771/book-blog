                    My friend and I decided to pick a couple of books to read together. We picked the Crane Among Wolves and this one. When we first
                    picked them out, I thought that I was going to like the Crane Among Wolves a lot better. But I was definitely mistaken. This book 
                    surprised me, and I'm so glad that I ended up reading it.

                    I thought this book was just about a girl who had sacrificed herself to the Sea God to save someone from her village, but it was much
                    more than that. After Mina sacrifices herself, she finds herself in the Sea God's palace and notices that the Sea God had actually been asleep
                    for all of these years. She has a bond with the Sea God that turns out to be a Red String of Fate. However, she meets three men who break this 
                    bond between her and the Sea God, vowing to protect the god. Despite this setback, she sets herself on a mission to find out how to wake
                    the Sea God and protect her village from the unpredictable storms that the Sea God's slumber has caused. Along the way, she meets the other
                    gods of this world and finds that no one really believes in the wishes of humans anymore. She's heartbroken, but she doesn't give up. And through
                    this journey, a Red String of Fate accidently forms between herself and the man who had broken her bond with the Sea God: Shin. At first,
                    she thinks that he's the same as everyone else, someone who doesn't care about humans. But she comes to realize that he cares more than both of them
                    thought- and they end up falling in love.

                    I really loved every part of this book- it became a favorite for me nearly right away. One thing I loved most about this book was the 
                    world-building and environment. Before I read this, I knew that people had related it to Spirited Away and other Studio Ghibli films, but I 
                    didn't realize how true it was until I read it. Every part of the book just feels whimsical and it was like I was under the sea with Mina.
                    What really helped with the mood and environment of this book was the fact that it was based on Korean folklore. I've always loved books
                    that are based on fairy tales and folklore, and this book was no exception. This book just felt so lively and colorful to me, and I appreciated
                    that.

                    The other thing I loved so much about this was the romance. They had misunderstandings of each other from the start, but they were resolved
                    after learning more about each other. It first started when the Red String of Fate formed, but then it blossomed into actual love. I could
                    really feel how much they cared for each other and I appreciated how Shin tried to understand how Mina felt. I was somewhat surprised when 
                    Shin turned out to actually be the Sea God, but I was actually glad. From the beginning, Mina was supposed to convince the Sea God to care 
                    about the humans, and Mina had tried to convince Shin of that throughout the entire book. I was sad when Mina returned to her world, but I
                    was glad that she was able to see her family again. Although I was relieved when Shin came back for her, I do wish there was a way that she 
                    could have stayed with her family while being with Shin.

                    My favorite aspect of this book was the plot. This book was only a little over 300 pages, but it managed to fit a well-written plot
                    in it. I felt like there were so many different scenes and plot points, but it all flowed together smoothly. Mina failed in her
                    mission many times, but then she just kept going with it and finding other ways to succeed. All of the characters were well thought out,
                    not just the main two characters. My favorite was definitely Namgi. I appreciated that he had a light-hearted demeanor and was kind
                    to Mina from the start.

                    I suspect that this book will remain one of my favorites for a long time, so I highly recommend it.
