Title: Chloe's Book Blog
Hours Worked: 12 hours

I created this blog because I'm a big fan of reading and I my own little place where I could write down all of my thoughts
on the books I read. I was thinking of project ideas and this felt like the perfect project for me to improve my HTML and CSS!

I made my project just with HTML and CSS. I thought I was going to use a little bit of javascript, but I decided not to for this
project. Because of that, I think I definitely learned a lot about HTML and CSS.

What I struggled with: I struggled with the nav bar and making sure that it looked decent. I had an idea in my head, but for some reason
I couldn't execute it the way I wanted with CSS. I ended up thinking about it for a while and I changed my idea so it looked nicer.

What I learned: I learned a lot more about how to utilize flexbox- especially through creating the cards for my reviews.

In the future, if I were to remake this project, I would learn more about databases so I could add a comment feature where each comment
is displayed without it deleting after reloading the page. I think I would also try to find a way to make it easier for me to create a review
or list entry, because as of now, I would just have to keep creating individual HTML pages and that might get inconvienent after a while.

Even though I struggled a few times while making this website, I really enjoyed deciding how to design and making this website.
