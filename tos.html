                    Honestly the main reason why I picked this book up was because I saw it on a list on Instagram of sapphic fantasies. There are 
                    so few gay fantasies and even fewer sapphic fantasies, so when I saw this on display in Barnes and Noble, I just had to buy it.
                    And I definitely didn't regret it.

                    This book is based on the story of Swan Lake. The main character Odile has been working as an actress and a thief for a sorcerer
                    after her parents died. She was born as a sorceress into a world that had shunned all types of sorcery after an incident where
                    a sorcerer went crazy. She is tasked to pretend to be Marie D'Odette, the woman who is said to be chosen by the Crown Prince as his 
                    wife. She transforms Marie into a swan and takes her appearance, acting as her in front of all who knew her. However, the evening
                    after the Crown Prince chose "Marie" as his wife, his father gets murdered- and the one who murdered him is said to be Odile's brother
                    who she hadn't seen in years, Damien. Odile soon realizes that she might need Marie's help, and the two slowly fall in love.

                    I felt that the plot was definitely pretty complex, but I didn't always love the atmosphere. I know that it was supposed to be dreary,
                    especially because it was a point in the book that the world had been cursed to be devoid of nature's color, but I still didn't like it.
                    I'm a fan of books that feel like they have more color and emotion to them.

                <p class="review-paragraph">
                    I liked how Odile had to deal with her past and the manipulation that she had faced for all of the years she worked under the sorcerer. 
                    I'm glad she finally realized that other people could care for her and that she was more than the sorcerer's "daughter". I also did enjoy
                    Odile and Marie's romance, but I got frustrated when there were so many misunderstandings between the two. Still, their relationship was 
                    relatively well-written.

                <p class="review-paragraph">
                    Overall, I did really like this book, but my biggest complaint was with the ending. After Marie got turned to stone, it felt rushed. I thought 
                    that there was going to be a sequel where Odile would find out how to transform her back into a human, but it turned out that it was summed up
                    in less than a chapter.

                <p class="review-paragraph">
                    Despite my complaints, I loved this book and it deserved my four star rating.
