                    <p> This series has three books:
                        Caraval, Legendary, and Finale. This series made me realize how much I love books that just feel magical.
                        Throughout these three books, particularly Caraval, I could just feel the magic in this world. I loved going
                        through the book and figuring out the mysteries when the main character did. Because of the magical elements,
                        it was difficult to predict what would happen next. I also thouroughly enjoyed the romance aspect of the series.
                        The relationships of the two couples were throughout all three of the books and I appreciated how they
                        impacted the plot. I also loved how the author created another book series in the same world with some of the 
                        same characters because I got to see what happened to them after the trilogy ended. This series will always
                        be one of my favorites and so I highly recommend it.

                    <p>This series is seriously one of my favorite series. For some reason, although it's fairly popular, it seems a little 
                        bit underrated to me. I've read the first two books, and the third one just came out, so I'm very excited to read it.
                        I read these books as a little treat every night before I go to bed, because they're just so cozy and comforting for me.
                        There are several issues and problems that Emily has to face, but the books just have an overall very warm and lighthearted
                        feeling to them. I love Emily and the love interest's romance together, it's just so cozy. These books will always be
                        a safe place for me.

                    <p>I read this series a while ago, so while I don't remember all the details, I still remember how much I loved it. I feel
                        like this series is a bit underrated and I wish more people talked about it. The first book is definitely my favorite 
                        because it really sets everything up and I loved the main character's story. I'll definitely need to reread this series 
                        soon!

                    <p>When I got these books from the library, I didn't even really know what it was about. All I knew was that I heard about it
                        somewhere online and that it was a Chinese fantasy novel. Little did I know was that I was about to read the first five books
                        in a couple of weeks. I wasn't completely sure of it at first because the first novel was a bit slow, but then it picked up
                        right away. The plot was so complex and it dove into the characters' backgrounds and emotions so well. This is a fantasy romance
                        book, so the romance was one of the biggest parts that made me love this series so much. The relationship was somewhat slowburn 
                        and it was just so fun to read. There were so many parts that made me laugh or cry, and I really just loved reading this series.
