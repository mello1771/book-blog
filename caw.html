                    My friend and I picked out two books to read together, and this was one of them. I had heard good things about it, so I thought that I was 
                    really going to like it. And while it was definitely fun to read, it was not as good as I thought it was going to be.
                </p>

                <p class="review-paragraph">
                    This book is about a girl, Suyeon, whose sister had been taken away by the corrupt and cruel king and her journey in saving her sister. She travels far away 
                    from her own village so she can be closer to where the king is keeping her sister, and she meets an innkeeper and a detective who help her on her 
                    mission. She also meets one of the princes, the one who is most favored by the king. She hates him at first, but to her surprise, he helps her. He had 
                    been done wrong by the king in the past, and he's ready to be rid of him. So Suyeon works together with these people that she's found in order to get her
                    sister back and overthrow the king.

                <p class="review-paragraph">
                    The plot itself of the book was definitely interesting, but it could have been written better. There were times when the main character had experienced
                    something heartwrenching, but as the reader, I couldn't feel it the same way she did. There were a lot of events that happened in this book, but it was 
                    just too rushed. I couldn't get super attached to characters that died or betrayed Suyeon, so I didn't feel the emotions that I was supposed to. It wasn't 
                    super well-written, but it wasn't like I didn't enjoy reading it.
                </p>

                <p class="review-paragraph">
                    I liked the relationship between the love interests a lot. I felt like it was understandable for Suyeon to hate him at first because he was a prince who 
                    was close to the king that had stolen her sister, but she didn't hold on to this hate when she realized how much he didn't want to be a monster like the king.
                    I was not a fan of how he pretended to have died, but I'm glad that they found and stayed with each other in the end. It wasn't my favorite book ever, but I'm 
                    still glad I read it.
